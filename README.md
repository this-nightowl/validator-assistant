# Nectar Validator Assistant

An interactive terminal user interface for configuring and managing validators on the **Nectar** network. Built with [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and styled using [Lip Gloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss).

## Features
- ðŸ’¡ Vibrant full-screen TUI with a stylized ASCII **Nectar** logo
- ðŸ§­ Menu-driven wizard for creating a new validator
- ðŸ§¾ Live YAML preview of configuration as you type
- ðŸ”§ Hooks for updating validators, Grafana setup, snapshots and reset tooling
- ðŸ§± Extensible architecture for future enhancements like automated deployment and dashboards

## Requirements
- Go 1.20+
- Git

## Running

To launch the assistant locally, run the project with Go:

```bash
go run .
```

This will start the interactive terminal UI. If you prefer to build a binary first, run:

```bash
go build -o validator-assistant
./validator-assistant
```

## Navigation
- `â†‘/â†“` move
- `Enter` select or confirm
- `Esc` go back
- `q` or `Ctrl+C` quit

The assistant guides you through filling out validator details. Configuration is previewed live and can later be used to automate deployment.
